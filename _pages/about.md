Hello! I am Ricardo Calvo.
I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University.

# Academic background
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Systems and Computer Engineering from the [National University of Colombia](https://unal.edu.co/).

During my last semester of my undergraduate studies, I was an exchange student at Purdue University, where I had the opportunity to work on research in the Duality Lab.

Two years later, I returned to Purdue University to pursue my PhD degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
