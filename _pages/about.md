Hello, I am Ricardo Calvo.

I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University.

# Academic background
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Systems and Computer Engineering from the [National University of Colombia](https://unal.edu.co/).

During the final semester of my undergraduate studies, I was an exchange student at [Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu), where I contributed to research in the [Duality Lab](https://davisjam.github.io/research/).

Two years later, I returned to Purdue University to pursue my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

# Professional background

I have nearly five years of industry experience as a software developer, technical lead, and QA engineer.

* As a **software developer** at [Fit Ideas](https://www.fitideas.ai/), I delivered projects for clients across industries, including banking and data automation.
* As a **technical lead** at Fit Ideas, I guided teams through design decisions, development execution, and project delivery.
* As a **QA engineer** at [Kravata](https://www.kravata.co/), I automated testing pipelines and implemented best practices across unit, integration, end-to-end, and performance testing using CI/CD tooling.

<!-- # Research Interests
I am new to research, so I have not defined my puntual research interests clearly yet. But I have a strong interest in the following areas:
* **Operating systems:** They are the basis for all computing systems. How could we improve their performance? How could we make them more secure?
* **Computer engineering:** Developers create the hardware and software systems that power our devices. How could we help the developers in their day-to-day work? How could we help them to be less afraid of creating vulnerable systems? -->
