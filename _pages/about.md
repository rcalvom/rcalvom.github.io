Hello there! I am Ricardo Calvo.

I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University.

# Academic background
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Systems and Computer Engineering from the [National University of Colombia](https://unal.edu.co/).

During my last semester of my undergraduate studies, I was an exchange student at the [Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu), where I had the opportunity to work on research in the [Duality Lab](https://davisjam.github.io/research/).

Two years later, I returned to Purdue University to pursue my PhD degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

# Professional background

I have worked during almost five years for industry as software developer, technical lead and QA engineer.

* As **software developer** I served to a consulting company [Fit Ideas](https://www.fitideas.ai/), where I worked on various projects for clients in different industries, from banking to data automation collection.
* As **technical lead** I have experience in leading development teams in Fit Ideas, taking design decisions, guiding the development process and ensuring the successful delivery of projects.
* As **QA engineer** I automated testing processes and implemented best practices to improve software quality. I automated unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and performance tests using the appropriate CI/CD tools and frameworks.

# Research Interests
I am new to research, so I have not defined my puntual research interests clearly yet. But I have a strong interest in the following areas:
* **Operating systems:** They are the basis for all computing systems. How could we improve their performance? How could we make them more secure?
* **Computer engineering:** Developers create the hardware and software systems that power our devices. How could we help the developers in their day-to-day work? How could we help them to be less afraid of creating vulnerable systems?

# Personal Life
* I love analog photography, here a small sample of my work:

* I love riding bike but I haven't had much time for it lately.
* I am a motorcycle driver, I love to visit towns in the middle of nowhere.


* I used to play the clarinet in a distinguished orchestra, but I had to stop due to my time constraints (University).
* There is no person more "Rolo" than me. I dance while clapping my hands and singing local cumbia.
* Chang√ºa lover. (Only Colombian people will understand)
* I am not bad doing improv.
