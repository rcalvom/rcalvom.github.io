I am from Bogotá, Colombia 🇨🇴 where I lived for 21 years. I am an ajiaco lover and a proud changua advocate 🍲.
Since 2025, I have been living in West Lafayette, Indiana, USA for my PhD at Purdue.

Here is my latest [Curriculum Vitae](/files/cv.pdf).

## My hobbies

* I started learning the guitar 🎸 and clarinet at age 8. For a while I dreamed of a professional music career, but I found a deeper passion in computing engineering. These days I play just for fun.
* I used to take ping-pong classes 🏓 and now I practice squash regularly.
* I own a [Honda Xblade 160](https://motos.honda.com.co/motos-honda/motos-sport/XBLADE-160) 🏍️ I love riding, but I have not done a long trip around Colombia yet, and that is on my list.
* I am an analog camera enthusiast 📸 I shoot negative film with a [Kodak EKTAR H35 Half Frame 35mm](https://www.kodak.com/en/consumer/product/cameras/film/h35-film-camera/) and instant film with a [Fujifilm Instax Mini 12](https://instax.com/mini_12/en/). Here are a few photos I have taken:
